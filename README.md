## NostalgiDate

This is my take on a Calendar app.
I've never really found anything that suited me as a user so I decided to come up with my own application,  always felt like the rigid design of modern apps put me off, so Im going for something a bit more retro and free flowing with this one.

So far I made the ToDo application part, I planned to finish the calender and notification system by the end of my semester in spring.
